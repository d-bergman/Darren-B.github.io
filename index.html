                        In February of 2019, I married my soulmate, Bhumika. My wife is from India, she is a Computer Engineer and a fantastic cook!
                    </p>

                        <!--Hobbies & Interesting-->
                        Other than spending my time on more serious things, I enjoy my time with family and friends, such as; Bike rides, walks, working out, watching TV shows, and traveling.
                        In the warmer weather I absolutely love to spar my friends with UltraSaber Lightsabers. 
                        I am person who loves, lives and breathes computers and technology. 
                        Whether it be; Wiki development/administration, website development, graphic designing, data management, or even some levels of coding, I love it all!

                        I have been told that I have big potential because I am extremely creative and put a major amount of effort into whatever I am working on.
                        But, one of my favorite mottoes is "There is always room for Improvement" in which; I thrive to apply it in my life.

                        <!--What i would like to become-->
                        My dream that I endeavor to achieve is to become someone who is very educated in the natural health field
                        and also in the ways of counseling and helping people with their problems but through holistic means.
                        I have always had a big interest and desire to learn and expand my knowledge about health. Whenever I see someone who is sick
                        or suffering, I feel a pull to try and rescue them by coaching them with ways to get better and improve themselves.
                        I found that this was my main desire and passion for my life and I am taking every step I can to achieve this goal.
                        Due to a lifetime of illness from birth, helping people with their health issues became a passion for me. 
                        I am actively looking for opportunities to further my knowledge to achieve my dream.

                        I was offered a position by the director of New Eden School to work as a writer and school administrator.
                        This has given me an opportunity to further advance my writing skills in a more professional aspect. 
                        Exams I finish have multiple different difficulties ranging from easy questions to very tricky questions,
                        this gives the very nature of the exam of what the director of the school was looking for.

                        I had the opportunity to work with New Eden School as a Project Manager/Admin of a team for developing a WordPress based student portal for online exams, conference videos and a in-built forum.
                        During this time I was responsible for communicating with two other colleagues that were part of the development process and worked with the director of the school
                        to bring forth the portal that he envisioned. Over the course of several months of work, we were able to finish the portal and I remained on board as an 
                        admininistrator. During the time as Administrator of the Student Portal, my responsibilities were to create student profiles and give them access to the exams I input into the 
                        portal. Exams were given to me by the school director after he redesigned them from the original written exam to a more suitable exam for online use.

                        This was technically my first real job in Retail and I learned a lot about customer service, handling merchandise, stocking, 
                        and how to be quick when figuring out where things were in the store. This was a great opportunity for me to learn what it was
                        like to work a job. During this time, I and several other employees helped to setup a store front in Spring Hill Mall. 
                        From this experience came most of my experience of what it took to setup a store and price merchandise.

                            I was offered a great opportunity to participate in the creation of content for Gemini
                            Station, a browser based space rpg game, created by Jon Wenzel.
                            The projects that I am currently working are; Administration of a MediaWiki Site, 
                            Administration/Moderation of an unofficial fan-based discord server, and administration of the forum.

                            <u><b>Wiki</b></u>: My main contribution towards Gemini Station at this time is their Wiki. I have given 
                            many hours of my time in the full creation of the wiki from the ground up. Once I had established the wiki
                            and finished a good portion of its main contents, others started contributing and editing the wiki. 
                            When new users join, I helped them better understand how to work the wiki when they asked to learn more. 
                            Those that did not ask to learn and just began their contributions, I simply fixed their edits and continued to maintain the wiki.
                            Other things I did on the wiki was create complex Templates using the more advanced wikicode and handled some of the CSS Styling. 
                            I also had to learn abit about php when interacting with the game's developer, having to install MediaWiki Extensions to allow some of the major
                            functionality to work properly. This wiki project has helped me learn quite alot more about the Wiki Markup Language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u><b>Discord</b></u>: Another big contribution towards this project for Gemini Station is the maintaining and administrating of the discord server.
                            I have run several discord servers before but never from a business perspective. Having the opportunity to perform as an admin for the game's discord server has taught me several things
                            about how to conduct myself in a professional setting such as; Managing a large group of people and how to properly and professionally handle conflicts. Through trial and error,
                            I was able to overcome great obstacles with help from the developer and other staff members in the community server.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am enjoying working on this project and expanding my knowledge in using Wiki Markup Language.
                            It is also known as Wikicode or Wikitext.

                            The Apocrypha is a Novel Series that I am writing. I am currently still working on the first book, but have plans to continue on until I have a five book series.
                            In this project I am utilizing an organizer called <a href="https://hiveword.com/"><u>Hiveword</u></a>. It has helped me big time when organizing my ideas, outlines, 
                            chapters, character profiles, and other things. It is a huge challenge for me to undertake this project, which started back in 2011. Ever since I was little and would 
                            play out in my backyard as a kid, I always had this one special story in my mind and decided to bring it into reality with a novel series. My wife and also a good friend have
                            supported my project, helping me in areas in which I have struggled. They both have given me a lot of inspiration and ideas to further my novel project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My novel series is about a survivor of an old ancient race with advanced technology. An elemental-like culture. This particular survivor is the protagonist of the story 
                            and begins by waking up from a slumber which lasted several hundred thousand years. The novel will be mixed genre; Fantasy and Science Fiction.

                            I just recently began the workings of figuring out how to develop a game based on my own novel's storyline. Working with Jon Wenzel with his game, Gemini Station,
                            has given me an idea of what its like to develop a game. I got an inspiration to start my own video game when talking with friends of mine and decided to create a game
                            that is based in 2.5D point of view. Quests, Open World, Adventure, Heavily story driven is what I want to include in this game. Currently we are in the process of talking
                            about how to start and sorting out who does what. Trello has been decided for use to organize our ideas, bug tracking and its development.
